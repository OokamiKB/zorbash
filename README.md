<!-- In days of old, The Zorbashian Empire discovered the Earth and they wrought much rage -->
<!-- upon her verdant soils. Their wrath was mighty and left the world scarred and in darkness. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Those that remain, scavenge amongst the ruins of once great cities. Religious zealotry -->
<!-- has taken hold and all technology is viewed as demonic magic and forbidden. To be found -->
<!-- with Zorbashian tech is a death sentence. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- The planet is now a hellscape. Lava flows freely from the gushing wounds in the soil -->
<!-- and deserts grow larger every year. The animals have mutated into fearsome beasts and -->
<!-- the only safety is to be found in the undercities. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Your task, nobel one, is only to survive, for in surviving we continue to resist. -->
<!-- If you are able to strike a blow against the Zorbashian demons then seek out their -->
<!-- many underground bases. It is from here they spawn from their far off realm. But -->
<!-- beware, they have many dread beasts guarding their bases. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Legend says that there is a master base somewhere, where the Emperor Zorbash resides. -->
<!-- Whether this is true or not, cannot be said but to strike at the heart of their rule -->
<!-- may be enough to drive the Zorbashians out. And then we can be free again. -->

- **** WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT PLAYABLE YET *****

Zorbash is a fusion of turn based and real-time based gaming, called "borrowed time",
which allows the player to do lots of moves in quick succession. The monsters will
get the same number of moves, but they move at their own pace. Watch out if you clock
up too many moves ahead. If you get stuck, the monsters might get lots of free hits
at you. Alternatively, race through the level as quick as you want, but never pause.
Or methodically move one step at a time, letting the monsters move in sync for a more
classical roguelike experience.

I'm still working on a theme :)
