                       Hark! Hear now a tale untold
                       since ancient times of yore
                       of Zorbash, forgotten beast of old, 
                       who dwelled deep near the Earth’s core
                       
                       ‘Twas from the Abyss he first arose,
                       Forged treasures gold and gleaming. 
                       A deadly lure to tempt all those
                       Prone to greed and scheming
                       
                       Many fell before his throne, 
                       Heroes fell asunder.
                       His lightning gaze turned flesh to bone
                       His roar was loud as thunder.
                       
                       Quenchless, thirsting, dripping gore
                       His thousand eyes unmatched
                       Until one tenacious band of four
                       From him vict’ry snatched. 
                       
                       Although, ‘twas not an easy fight -
                       A sacrifice was made.
                       A volunteer, their faithful knight,
                       Made sure the price was paid. 
                       
                       As godlings, the remaining three
                       rose with fame and glory
                       But that’s not yet the finale
                       Of Zorbanadu’s dark story.
                       
                       For in the depths of Zorbash’s den, 
                       A necromancer schemed.
                       She planned to raise the beast again,
                       And rule as his Dark Queen.
                       
                       So now Zorbash has come to life - 
                       (Though ‘tis more like life’s dark shadow)
                       With his fiersome undead wife
                       Can you save us all, dear hero?
