<!-- In days of old, The Zorbashian Empire discovered the Earth and they wrought much rage -->
<!-- upon her verdant soils. Their wrath was mighty and left the world scarred and in darkness. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Those that remain, scavenge amongst the ruins of once great cities. Religious zealotry -->
<!-- has taken hold and all technology is viewed as demonic magic and forbidden. To be found -->
<!-- with Zorbashian tech is a death sentence. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- The planet is now a hellscape. Lava flows freely from the gushing wounds in the soil -->
<!-- and deserts grow larger every year. The animals have mutated into fearsome beasts and -->
<!-- the only safety is to be found in the undercities. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Your task, nobel one, is only to survive, for in surviving we continue to resist. -->
<!-- If you are able to strike a blow against the Zorbashian demons then seek out their -->
<!-- many underground bases. It is from here they spawn from their far off realm. But -->
<!-- beware, they have many dread beasts guarding their bases. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Legend says that there is a master base somewhere, where the Emperor Zorbash resides. -->
<!-- Whether this is true or not, cannot be said but to strike at the heart of their rule -->
<!-- may be enough to drive the Zorbashians out. And then we can be free again. -->

Zorbash is a roguelike that lets you choose the way you want play, classical turn-based or real-time.

How it works. You can move as quick as you want, one move at a time, or race around the level.
The monsters will get the same number of moves as you but will move at their own pace.

This allows the player to do lots of moves in quick succession to overtake slow monsters or
get to the loot before they can react.

This can lead to a shock if you race around the level and then bump into a monster with
lots of saved up attacks!

This is work in progress. It's sort of playable right now but probably way too tough.
Comments and suggestions welcome at this early stage.
