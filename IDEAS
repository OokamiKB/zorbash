monsters adapt to overuse of a weapon type
old gods to new gods scale
runes lean more torwards old gods
bibles and stuff lean to new gods

damage system like terraria
---------------------------
weapon-damage-chance
net-damage = min(weapon-min-damage, weapon-attack - (monst-defense * 0.5))
net-damage = min(weapon-min-damage, weapon-attack - (monst-defense * 0.75) expert mode)

For example:
With 20 defense, a 40 damage attack is reduced by 10, resulting in 30 damage taken: 40 - (20 * 0.5) = 30
With 30 defense, a 40 damage attack is reduced by 15, resulting in 25 damage taken: 40 - (30 * 0.5) = 25
